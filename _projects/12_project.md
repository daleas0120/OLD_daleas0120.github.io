By far the most extensive instrumentation project I undertook, and documented in my MS Physics thesis.

As a reminder, Langmuir Blodgett deposition was pioneered by the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Pockels">Agnes Pockels</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Burr_Blodgett">Katherine Blodgett</a>.  The basic idea is to deposit a self-orienting monolayer on top of a polar subphase, then leverage the surface dynamics to transfer the monolayer to a substrate

I inherited a KSV Langmuir Blodgett chassis and some microelectronics c. 1991, kitted out for surface tension studies.  The first step to rehabilitation was designing and fabricating a new tray with a reservoir suitable for thin film deposition.  Ebay is an excellent source of raw materials.

After the trough was fabricated, I had to reverse engineer some control software since the original drivers were long gone.  The basic control flow is shown below

This included assembling and calibrating a desktop dipper from an arduino, stepper motor, and linear actuator.  When finally assembled, the system looked like this.

I added a giant plastic box to keep debris from falling onto the trough surface, and jammed the whole thing inside a fume hood.

    </div>

I eventually added a surface balance and put the whole thing in a tray of sand to further damp vibrations which might disturb my thin film.  The whole thing works pretty good.
