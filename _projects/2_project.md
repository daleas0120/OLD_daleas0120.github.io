A side project was learning how to improve the quality of the ferroelectric thin films we fabricated in our lab using poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP).  Samples were fabricated with the following structure to avoid edge affects:

    Ferroelectric capacitor structure visualization.  The SiO2 wafer substrate is shown in dark grey, with a bottom electrode formed by a thin films of Cu (orange) capped by an Al thin film (light grey) partially covering the substrate.  The ferroelectric layer is shown in clear, with the PVDF-HFP polymer chains oriented on the substrate .  The top electrode is another Al thin film (light grey) wih a thicker thin film of Au (yellow).

The differences in samples between those fabricated manually and those from an automated system are visible to the eye.

A simple Sawyer-Tower circuit can do the trick for hysteresis measurements, but we used Radiant Ferroelectric tester to evaluate the improvement in thin film quality
