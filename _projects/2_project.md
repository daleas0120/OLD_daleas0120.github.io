A side project was learning how to improve the quality of the ferroelectric thin films we fabricated in our lab using poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP).  Samples were fabricated with the following structure to avoid edge affects:

    </div>

A simple Sawyer-Tower circuit can do the trick for hysteresis measurements, but we used Radiant Ferroelectric tester to evaluate the improvement in thin film quality
