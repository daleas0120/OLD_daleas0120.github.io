In collaboration with the Office of Naval Research and NSWC Crane, we created a series of six 3D short films formatted for autostereoscopic display to educate warfighters on the basics of RF communication principles.  My contributions included the design and calculation of different antenna power envelope patterns, script writing, voice acting, 3D animation, and close collaboration with the Media Arts and Sciences team.

It was a fabulous experience, and I very much enjoyed presenting our results at the 2018 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference.[1]
